We propose a Large-scale Attribute Dataset (LAD) which has 78,017 images of 5 super-classes, 230 classes. The image number of LAD is larger than the sum of the four most popular attribute datasets (AwA, CUB, aP/aY and SUN). 359 attributes of visual, semantic and subjective properties are defined and annotated in instance-level.
<br>
We organized an international Zero-shot Learning Competition under AI Challenger using this dataset. More than 110 teams attended the competition.
<br>
For fair comparison, we provide standard splits of classes for ZSL and splits of images for traditional supervised Learning (packaged in the data).
